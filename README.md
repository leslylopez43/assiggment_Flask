## PEP 8 Code Style Check
This project follows the PEP 8 style guidelines to maintain a consistent and readable codebase. To ensure adherence to these guidelines, we use the pycodestyle tool to check our Python code for style violations.

### Installation
To check your Python code against the PEP 8 style guidelines, you need to have pycodestyle installed.  

1. **Install `pycodestyle`**:
   If you haven't installed `pycodestyle` yet, you can find it on PyPI (Python Package Index) at the following link:
   [pycodestyle on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pycodestyle/)

   You can install `pycodestyle` using `pip` by running the following command:

2. **Run `pycodestyle` on your Python file**:
Open a terminal or command prompt and execute the following command:
Replace `nameofpythonfile.py` with the actual name of the Python file you want to test.

3. **Review the output**:
If there are no errors or warnings displayed in the output, it means your code meets the PEP 8 standards.



## Running PEP 8 Check
Once you have pycodestyle installed, you can run the following command in your terminal or command prompt to check a specific Python file:

## About PEP 8
PEP 8 is the official style guide for Python code, providing guidelines on how to format and structure your code to enhance readability and maintainability. Adhering to PEP 8 helps create a consistent coding style across the Python community.

For more information on PEP 8, you can visit the official Python website: PEP 8 -- Style Guide for Python Code
